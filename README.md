Welcome to my GitHub!  
I’m passionate about building intelligent solutions and exploring the world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Currently, I’m sharpening my Python skills and working towards my goal of becoming a Software Engineer.

- 🌱 Currently learning: Advanced Python, AI, and ML concepts
- 💡 Interested in: Creating innovative projects with real-world impact
- 🤝 Open to collaborating on Python, AI/ML, and software engineering projects

## Projects
✅ Your Current Projects (With Suggestions)
1. Chess Game (Offline AI + Online Multiplayer)
  - Shows frontend + backend dev
  - Demonstrates AI + search algorithms (minimax, alpha-beta pruning)
  - Networking knowledge (websockets, client-server)
  - Show AI playing with different difficulty levels (e.g. depth-limited)
  - Add a simple user authentication system
  - Use a real-time database (e.g. Firebase or Supabase for matchmaking)
  - Add an "AI learns from you" feature (self-play reinforcement learning light)

2. Your Own Git System
  - Deep dive into core systems: filesystems, hashing, versioning
  - You’ll understand how git, commits, diff, etc. work
  - Make it visual: CLI + web dashboard to see diffs, commits, graphs
  - Support basic git commands: init, add, commit, log, diff, branch, checkout
  - Implement hash trees (Merkle trees) for commit verification

3. Neural Network from Scratch
  - Shows mathematical and low-level understanding of ML
  - You’ll learn how backpropagation, optimizers, etc. actually work
  - Implement common use-cases (image classification, XOR gate, etc.)
  - Compare my results with PyTorch or TensorFlow

Make it a blog series or tutorial to demonstrate communication skills
